LT_I2C: Routines to communicate with ATmega328P's hardware I2C port.

@verbatim

LT_I2C contains the low level routines to communicate with devices using the
ATMega328's onboard hardware I2C port. Each routine checks the Two Wire Status
Register (TWSR) at the end of the transaction and returns 0 if successful and 1
if not successful.

I2C Frequency = (CPU Clock frequency)/(16+2(TWBR)*Prescaler)

TWBR-Two Wire Bit Rate Register
TWCR=Two Wire Control Register (TWINT TWEA TWSTA TWSTO TWWC TWEN - TWIE)
TWSR=Two Wire Status Register

Prescaler Values:
TWSR1  TWSR0  Prescaler
   0      0      1
   0      1      4
   1      0      16
   1      1      64

Examples:
CPU Frequency = 16Mhz on Arduino Uno
I2C Frequency  Prescaler  TWSR1  TWSR0  TWBR
  1khz         64         1      1      125
  10khz        64         1      1      12
  50khz        16         1      0      10
  100khz        4         0      1      18
  400khz        1         0      0      12
