Details Encoder and Codewheel
=======================

<img src="../images/broadcom_encoder_1.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Encoder and Codewheel from Encoder Kit AEDM-5810-Z12*  

Description
------------
The highest resolution codewheels with 5000cpr are only available in the Encoder Kit or from codewheel manufacturers.

So there are two options:
* You can either order the AEDM-5810-Z12 encoder kit that consists of the encoder and the 5000cpr codewheel attached to a aluminum mount. (Option A - below)  
* Or you can order the Broadcom AEDT-9810-Z00 encoder without the codewheel and have the codewheel manufactured. (Option B - below)

### Option A - Encoder Kit

#### Instructions:
* Find and order the AEDM-5810-Z12 encoder kit
* Disassemble the encoder kit and extract the encoder and the codewheel.
* Dissasembly instructions can be found [here](details_encoder_kit_disassembly.md).
* Modify the aluminium flange according to [this drawing](../drawings/codewheel_modification.PDF)
* Use the correct stl to print encoder mount (the encoder mounts for the two options are different)


### Option B - Codewheel Fabrication

We have ordered the codewheels from PWB in Germany. [PWB Website](https://www.pwb-encoders.com)  
Broadcom has codewheel manufacturer lists for different countries.  
We cannot share the list here but you can ask the Broadcom support for a list of code wheel suppliers in your region.

### Instructions:

* Find and order the AEDT-9810-Z00 encoder
* Find a codewheel manufacturer in your region (ask the Broadcom Support for suppliers)
* Ask them for a quote for producing a 5000cpr codewheel with index for the AEDT9810 encoder
* Details: 625 lines / optical radius:11mm / disc diameter: 25,56mm / Inner bore diameter: 7mm
