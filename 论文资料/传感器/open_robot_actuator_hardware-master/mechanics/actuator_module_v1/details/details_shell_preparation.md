Metric Theads

<img src="../images/tap_drill.jpg" width="400"> <br>*M3 Tap Drill*

* Use a M3 tap drill and cut a thread in the 4 locations shown above (2 x encoder mount / 2 x timing belt tensioner)
* Try to hold the tap drill as vertical as possible
* You can tap all the way through the shell

Helicoil Threaded Inserts
--------------------
<img src="../images/helicoil_tools.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Helicoil Tools - Tap drill, tang-break-off tool and insertion tool*

* We use Helicoil Threaded inserts for increased stability
* You need the 3 special Helicoil tools shown in the picture above for each size
* For the actuator module you will need the tools and threaded inserts for M2,5 and M3
* Try to hold the tap drill as vertical as possible
* Stop when the resistance increases - the threads in the 3d printed parts can strip easily
* The size and length of the Helicoil inserts is documented in the screenshots above

Adjusting the Bearing seats
----------------------------
<img src="../images/end_mills_1.jpg" width="400"> <br>*8mm and 32mm end mills*

* Since the tolerances of the 3d printed parts can vary we print the bearing seats a bit tighter and machine them to the right size
* For that we use end mills with a sharp 90 degree edge
* We recommend not to use reamers, because they are typically chamfered and won't produce a clean contact surface
* You should dull the blades on the bottom with a file - such that the end mills remove material on the sides only
