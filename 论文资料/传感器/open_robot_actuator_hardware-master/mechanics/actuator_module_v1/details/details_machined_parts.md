Details Machined Parts
=======================

Timing Belt Pulleys
-----------
### Description:

For best performance the tooth profile of the pulleys has to be very precise.  
You can order a custom form cutter with the right cutting profile geometry and machine the parts on a milling machine.  
(Option A below)  
Alternatively you can use Wire EDM (Wire Electrical Discharge) machining to generate the 2d tooth profile.  
(Option B below)  
The remaining machining steps can be done on a lathe.   

**Caution: Don't use standard AT3 timing belt pulley dimensions or tools.  
We modified the original AT3 tooth profile in order to reduce backlash.**

### Option A - Form Cutter

#### Instructions
* Find a company that offers custom tooling and that can produce custom form cutters.  
* Send them this [PDF Drawing](../drawings/pulley_at3_t10_form_cutter.PDF) and ask them to quote a custom form cutter that will create the specified profile.
* You should mention that the tool will be used to machine 7075 aluminum.
* We use a 3mm shaft form cutter with 3 teeth at a helix angle of 20 degrees.
* When you have received your custom form cutter send the tool and the drawings below to a machine shop of your choice and have the parts machined.
