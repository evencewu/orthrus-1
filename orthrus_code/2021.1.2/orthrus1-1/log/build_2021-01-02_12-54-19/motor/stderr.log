CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmessage.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "message", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "message" with any
  of the following names:

    messageConfig.cmake
    message-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "message" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "message_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "message" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
